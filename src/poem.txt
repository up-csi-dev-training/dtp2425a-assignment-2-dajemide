★ "Whispers of the Universe" ★

The moon whispers softly across the night,  
Its silver everglow a calm, ethereal light.  
Waves kiss the shore with a rhythmic sigh,  
As stars like secrets fill the sky.  

The trees stand tall, in silence they sway,  
Guardians of dreams till the break of day.  
A breeze hums low, a lullaby sweet,  
Guiding the world where night and dawn meet.  

Mountains rainbow loom, their peaks touch the sky,  
Timeless, unmoving, though clouds "Tokyo drift" by.  
Rivers flow onward, a journey untold,  
Carving through valleys, both gentle and bold.  

The earth hums deep, a song of its own,  
Of life it cradles, of seeds it has sown.  
In this quiet, the universe breathes,  
A pulse in the cosmos and wandas that never deceives.  

And as the dawn paints the sky in gold,  
A new story begins, yet the old is retold.
The cycle of life, ever turning, spins,
As day gives way to where night begins.
